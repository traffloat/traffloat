## What is this game about?

As the overseer of an isolated space station,
the player guides inhabitants to construct
a thriving metropolis in the vastness of space
through meticulous planning and resource management.
Explore borderless territories, discover countless new physics,
research unlimited technologies,
adapt to the everchanging environment,
with a variety of inhabitant demands and activities to respond to &mdash;
as long as you still play the game,
it always generates new game elements to enrich your world.

What to expect from the game:

- **Logistics**: Resources are derived from different collectors and factories.
  Insufficiency of any resource may slow down the efficiency of the whole city.
- **Traffic**: Resources are transferred in different forms,
  like cargo vehicles, fluid pipes and electric cables.
  Optimize transportation routes to maximize production.
- **City management**: Buildings and vehicles are operated by inhabitants.
  Manage their commutes, skills and well-being to improve productivity.
  Respond to their demands to prevent crime.
- **3D**: Explore new transportation mechanics in a
  in a [genuinely 3D][tvtropes-2d-space] network of buildings.
  Become a leading architect for 3D cities.
- **Research**: New physical laws are generated by the game over time.
  Nobody except the Random Number Generator knows how they work &mdash;
  continuously research new phenomena to harness their power
  and protect the city from getting consumed by the unknown science.
- **Exploration**: In the vast emptiness of the space,
  there are still many visible resources and invisible energy fields around.
  Explore the dynamically generated map to unlock new resources.
- **Cooperative**: Cooperative multiplayer is (will be) supported.
  Work together to develop the metropolis and thrive even better.
- **Diplomatic**: PvP is (will be) supported.
  Build trade relations with other players to become a business tycoon,
  but beware sabotages from espionage, both physical and social.
