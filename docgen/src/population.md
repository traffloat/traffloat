# Population
The space colony is operated by inhabitants.

## Birth
Inhabitants are produced by asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction

Asexual reproduction is performed manually in the [core](../building/core).
Given sufficient amount of [DNA](../cargo/dna) is available,
players can initiate asexual reproduction using the core building menu.
The created inhabitants will be assigned any random available housing in the colony.

Sexual reproduction is performed spontaneously in houses.
Two inhabitants living in the same colony will
randomly give birth to children based on their skills like happiness.
The child will be assigned to the same housing as its parents.

## Lifecycle
*Main article: [Skill](../skill)*

Inhabitants are born with low skill points in each area.
Skill points increase slowly as time passes,
but can be boosted by attending [schools](../building#education).
Inhabitants operate vehicles or buildings more effectively
when they have higher skill points in the relevant areas.

Other attributes of an inhabitant are also generalized as skills,
such as age, health and happiness.
An inhabitant dies when its health reaches zero.
