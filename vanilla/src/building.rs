//! Vanilla building definitions.
//!
//! # Adding a new building
//! 1. Open `vanilla/src/building.rs`.
//! 2. Navigate to the `buildings! { ... }` block.
//! 3. Each top-level block is in the format `snake_case_category "Real category name" ("Category description") { ...
//!    }`. Find an appropriate category or add a new category for the new building.
//! 4. Add a `snake_case` identifier for the building, then curly braces with the data fields
//!     Every field is in the form `property: value,`. Do not forget to add the trailing comma.
//! 5. Add the texture of the building to a new directory in `client/textures`.
//!
//! ## Data fields
//! The following data fields are required in `vanilla/src/building.rs`:
//! - `name`: The name of the building.
//! - `summary`: A one-line short description of the building.
//! - `description`: The full description in markdown format.
//! - Shape of the building
//!     - If the building is a cube, write `cube` with the half-length of each side.
//!     - If the building is a cuboid, write `cuboid` with the two corners,
//!         e.g. `cuboid: [-1., -2. -3.] .. [4., 5., 6.]` means that
//!         the building is a cuboid with two opposite corners at (-1, -2, -3) and (4, 5, 6)
//!         respectively.
//! - `texture`: The directory name of the building texture.
//!     Conventionally, this name should be the `kebab-case` of the building.
//! - `reactions`: The list of reactions supported by the building.
//!     The list is comma-separated and surrounded by a pair of `[]`.
//!     See the documentation on [reactions][super::reaction] for adding new reaction types.
//!     Each reaction is in the format `reaction_name { ... }`,
//!     where `...` are building-specific options on the reaction.
//!     See [`building::ReactionPolicy`] for possible options.
//! - `hitpoint`: The full hitpoints of the building type.
//! - `storage`: The maximum amount of cargo, liquid and gas stored in the building,
//!     in the format `{cargo: 1000., liquid: 2000., gas: 3000.,}`.
//!     - The storage is used as a temporary buffer for reaction input/output,
//!         liquid transfer and gas diffusion.
//!         The storage restricts the maximum amount of liquid and gas
//!         that passes through the building per second.
//!         Therefore, the storage size should be larger than
//!         the total factory input/output per second,
//!         and reasonably much larger than the amount of liquid/gas passing through per second,
//!         otherwise the building would be the bottleneck for transfer.
//!     - The gas storage is used to buffer oxygen that inhabitants breathe.
//!         If the gas storage is too small, inhabitants without oxygen bottles may suffocate.
//! - `features`: A list of extra features (in addition to reactions) supported by the building,
//!     separated by comma and surrounded by `[]`.
//!     See [`building::ExtraFeature`] for possible options.
//!
//! ## Texture
//! ### Cube/Cuboid
//! The texture directory contains 6 files: `xp.svg`, `xn.svg`, `yp.svg`, `yn.svg`, `zp.svg`,
//! `zn.svg`.
//! Each file represents the shape of the building in the +X/-X/+Y/-Y/+Z/-Z direction.
//! While the dimension is not constrained,
//! each file is rescaled to different sprites of
//! 16&times;16, 64&times;64, 256&times;256 and 1024&times;1024 pixels
//! during the texture preprocessing phase.
//! It is fine to create an SVG file with a rectangular shape;
//! it will be stretched to a square shape during preprocessing phase,
//! then compressed back to a rectangle when it is rendered.
