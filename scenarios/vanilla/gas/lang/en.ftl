oxygen = Oxygen
oxygen-summary = Needed for breathing
oxygen-description = Oxygen is required for survival of inhabitants. Inhabitants cannot work in buildings with low oxygen content, except for construction work, where sufficient oxygen must be available in adjacent buildings.
oxygen-bottle = Gas bottle (Oxygen)
oxygen-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of Oxygen
oxygen-bottle-description = Produced in gas bottlers and centrifuges, gas bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of gas to factories as a replacement of diffusing gas slowly through corridors.

carbon-dioxide = Carbon dioxide
carbon-dioxide-summary = Photosynthesis material
carbon-dioxide-description = Carbon dioxide is produced in houses and consumed in oxygen farms. While high carbon dioxide level is not necessarily fatal, they reduce the levels of other gases in the air.
carbon-dioxide-bottle = Gas bottle (Carbon dioxide)
carbon-dioxide-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of Carbon dioxide
carbon-dioxide-bottle-description = Produced in gas bottlers and centrifuges, gas bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of gas to factories as a replacement of diffusing gas slowly through corridors.

nitrogen = Nitrogen
nitrogen-summary = An abundant, safe gas for pressure regulation
nitrogen-description = Nitrogen is found in abundant amounts. Although chemically inactive, they are great for pressure regulation and can be condensed to produce coolants.
nitrogen-bottle = Gas bottle (Nitrogen)
nitrogen-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of Nitrogen
nitrogen-bottle-description = Produced in gas bottlers and centrifuges, gas bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of gas to factories as a replacement of diffusing gas slowly through corridors.
