asteroidal-water = Asteroidal water
asteroidal-water-summary = Water found on asteroids
asteroidal-water-description = Deposits of water can sometimes be found in asteroids. Contaminated by asteroidal minerals, it must be filtered to be used in factories,\n            or deionized so that it is drinkable by inhabitants.
asteroidal-water-bottle = Liquid bottle (asteroidal water)
asteroidal-water-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of asteroidal water
asteroidal-water-bottle-description = Produced in liquid bottlers and centrifuges, liquid bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of liquid to factories as a replacement of constructing dedicated pipes through corridors.

filtered-water = Filtered water
filtered-water-summary = Water without insoluble impurities.
filtered-water-description = Filtered water is removed of insoluble impurities, so they can be used in other factories without clogging up conduits.
filtered-water-bottle = Liquid bottle (filtered water)
filtered-water-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of filtered water
filtered-water-bottle-description = Produced in liquid bottlers and centrifuges, liquid bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of liquid to factories as a replacement of constructing dedicated pipes through corridors.

deionized-water = Deionized water
deionized-water-summary = Drinking water
deionized-water-description = Soluble impurities in water are removed from water during deionization. This makes the water safe for inhabitant intake.
deionized-water-bottle = Liquid bottle (deionized water)
deionized-water-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of deionized water
deionized-water-bottle-description = Produced in liquid bottlers and centrifuges, liquid bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of liquid to factories as a replacement of constructing dedicated pipes through corridors.

urine = Urine
urine-summary = Waste produced by inhabitants
urine-description = Urine are organic waste produced by inhabitants in houses. Arrange sewage pipes to remove them from houses and recycle them by distillation into drinking water.
urine-bottle = Liquid bottle (urine)
urine-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of urine
urine-bottle-description = Produced in liquid bottlers and centrifuges, liquid bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of liquid to factories as a replacement of constructing dedicated pipes through corridors.

coolant = Coolant
coolant-summary = A liquid at very low temperature
coolant-description = Coolants are produced by condensation of nitrogen. They are required in factories with highly exothermic reactions.
coolant-bottle = Liquid bottle (coolant)
coolant-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of coolant
coolant-bottle-description = Produced in liquid bottlers and centrifuges, liquid bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of liquid to factories as a replacement of constructing dedicated pipes through corridors.

contaminated-liquid = Contaminated liquid
contaminated-liquid-summary = Unusable liquid
contaminated-liquid-description = A useless liquid caused by mixing different types of liquids. This liquid type cannot be used for anything, damaging most factories it flows into.
contaminated-liquid-bottle = Liquid bottle (contaminated-liquid)
contaminated-liquid-bottle-summary = Stores a small amount of contaminated-liquid
contaminated-liquid-bottle-description = Produced in liquid bottlers and centrifuges, liquid bottles can be used to transfer a small amount of liquid to factories as a replacement of constructing dedicated pipes through corridors.
