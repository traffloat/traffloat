      summary: Filter insoluble impurities from water
      description: "Asteroidal water is often mixed with different sorts of junk. These solid impurities will clog and damage conduits if passed directly. A filtration plant can separate the solid junk from the water.\n\nAlthough filtered water is still not edible for inhabitants, it demonstrates most of the physical properties of water, such as the high heat capacity and low viscosity. Therefore, filtered water is sufficient for most industrial uses."
